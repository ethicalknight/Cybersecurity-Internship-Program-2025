Hybrid Analysis Summary for Trojan.GenericKD.3638405
1. Overview

The submitted malware sample identified as Trojan.GenericKD.3638405 was analyzed in a sandboxed environment designed to simulate typical Windows 10 endpoints. The sandbox captures the runtime behavior, file system, registry changes, network activity, and process execution of the sample.
2. Behavioral Analysis

    Process Execution: The sample executed a primary process that attempted to spawn additional child processes consistent with malware persistence or spreading techniques.

    File System Activity: Multiple files were created and/or modified, primarily in temporary and user profile folders, indicative of payload installation or data staging.

    Registry Modifications: The malware added suspicious entries to the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key to achieve persistence after reboot.

    Network Communication: The sample attempted outbound connections over HTTP and DNS to several suspicious domains/IPs (likely command-and-control servers) to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.

    Anti-Analysis Techniques: Slight obfuscation or packing was detected but did not prevent the analysis engine from fully executing key malicious routines.

    Communication Protocols: Communications were seen on standard ports (e.g., TCP 80, 443), with DNS queries showing potential for data exfiltration using DNS tunneling or callbacks.

3. Artifacts Observed

    Created temporary logs and dropped additional executable components.

    Modified critical system files with timestamps matching the execution period.

    Created scheduled tasks or startup items to maintain presence.

    Triggered alerts for network traffic anomalies by the sandbox environment.

4. Impact Assessment

    The malware demonstrated the ability to infiltrate and persist on typical Windows 10 systems.

    Potential for data compromise or system control through persistent backdoor access.

    Network communication indicates possible botnet or targeted data exfiltration use.

5. Detection and Mitigation Recommendations

    Quarantine or delete all files matching the observed hashes.

    Block domains and IP addresses detected in outbound connections at network perimeter.

    Monitor for registry run keys and scheduled tasks matching observed patterns.

    Use updated antivirus and endpoint detection tools to recognize the sample.

    Inform users to avoid suspicious email attachments or downloads that could carry this Trojan.
